    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <h3>Dr. Carl</h3>
    <p>
        Dr. Carl is a well established physician who recently moved to New Mexico to work for Lovelace. He is interested in finding New Mexican furniture to compliment the new home he purchased. After doing some browsing online, he came across the Builds By Broten Website. After opening the home page of the website, it populates Jens instagram photos. This gives an up-to-date idea of what Jens is capable of doing for him. Dr. Carl decides he is interested in discussing pricing with Jens, so he submits a request to be contacted by answering a few contact questions. These questions include both contact information and additional information about what kind of product they would be interested in. At this point Jens will recieve an email notification with all of Dr. Carls information, and he can contact him at his next availability.

    <h3>Mr. Burton</h3>
    <p>
        Mr. Burton is a senior developer for one of New Mexico's newest start up businesses. His business focuses primarily on fullstack web development. After posting for Jr. Developer positions on glassdoor, he runs across Jonathans application. The application invites Mr. Burton to review Jonathans website he developed titled "Builds By Broten". Mr. Burton reviews the website using the inspect element to criticize Jonathans work. He decides that he likes how Jonathan was appropriately using the html tags and also neatly organized his CSS. Jonathan was offered a Jr. Developer position and finally got his foot in the door into the world of tech!
