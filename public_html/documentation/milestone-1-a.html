          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Pre-Condition:<br> Dr. Carl is a well
            established physician who
            recently moved to New Mexico to work for Lovelace.
            He is interested in finding New Mexican furniture to compliment the new home he
            purchased.<br>
            <br>

            Step by step:<br>
            Dr. Carl isnt really a technology person outside of his profession, so he is using the
            chrome mobile app. After doing some
            browsing online, he came across the Builds By Broten Website. Dr. Carls opens the home
            page of the
            website and it populates Jens instagram photos. This gives an up-to-date idea of what
            Jens
            is
            capable of doing for him. Dr. Carl decides he is interested in discussing pricing with
            Jens, so he submits a
            request in the form by answering a few questions. These questions include both contact
            information and additional information about what kind of product they would be
            interested
            in.

            <br><br>
            Post Condition:<br>
            At this point Jens will recieve an email notification with all of Dr. Carls information,
            and he can contact
            him at his next availability.

            Mr. Burton is a senior developer for one of
            New Mexico's newest start up businesses, and is looking for recruits.<br><br><br>

            Step by step:<br>
            His business focuses primarily on fullstack web development. After posting for Jr.
            Developer positions
            on glassdoor, he runs across Jonathans application. The application invites Mr. Burton
            to
            review
            Jonathans website he developed titled "Builds By Broten". Mr. Burton reviews the website
            using the inspect
            element to criticize Jonathans work. He decides that he likes how Jonathan was
            appropriately using
            the html tags and also neatly organized his CSS.
            <br><br><br>

            Post Condition:
            <br>
            Jonathan was offered a Jr. Developer position and finally got his foot in the door into
            the world of tech!
