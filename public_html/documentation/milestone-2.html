        Builds By Broten is going to be for my good friend who furnishes tables from scratch using wood slabs and epoxy.
        He has a quickly growing client base and is in need of a website. Jens told me he has three priorities:<br>
        1. A gallery to view available pieces, for this I was thinking I could link a private instagram so he can add or delete photos as his inventory changes.<br>
        2. A gallery to view pieces he would like to highlight. For this I could either link his currently active business instagrams posts which is currently operating as the same thing, or I could manually add photos and position them myself.<br>
        3. A request a quote option, here I was expecting to place a form that I could code to email him the information he needs.<br><br>
        With those three priorities in mind, I wanted to design the site as follows:<br>
        1. Site header, will have drop down box that navigates user to any of the sections below.<br>
        2. Jumbotron with site title and attractive image.<br>
        3. About Jens bio.<br>
        4. Highlighted pieces.<br>
        5. Available pieces.<br>
        6. Request information form.<br>
